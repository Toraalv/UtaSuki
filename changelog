v1.1.0 ui-rework

- profile now always visible when visiting your own tracks
- added border-radius to almost everything
- added hover and focus animations to a lot of input/a elements
- "your tracks" button now always active when visiting any of your years
- login and registering are now separate
- logins can be done anywhere on the site
	- this is especially nice if you wanted to add a track, but your
	auth_token just expired, so you can just login again and the inputted data
	will still be there
- new accounts will now be private by default
